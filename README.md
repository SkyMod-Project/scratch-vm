## SkyMod-Project/scratch-vm

Modified Scratch VM with a JIT compiler and more features.

This is a drop-in replacement for LLK/scratch-vm.

## Setup

See https://github.com/SkyMod-Project/scratch-gui/wiki/Getting-Started to setup the complete SkyMod environment.

If you just want to play with the VM then it's the same process as upstream scratch-vm.

## Extension authors

If you only use the standard reporter, boolean, and command block types, everything should just work without any changes.

## Compiler Overview

For a high-level overview of how the compiler works, see https://skymod-project.github.io/docs/how

For more technical information, read the code in src/compiler.
